- Rename package from marginPhase to margin

- Make view data structure memory efficient
- Make alignment uncertainty view
- Make phasing view
- Tune pair hmm
- Adapt signal-to-read hmm

- Adapt so we have a common binary "margin" with subcommands "margin phase" and "margin polish"
- Build margin polish top level script, which takes a bam file and outputs a bam with a polished assembly and reads aligned to it
- Develop combined phasing / polish algorithms
